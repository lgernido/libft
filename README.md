This is the first project at 42.

The goal is to code a set a function that will be reused during all of our studies in our own librairy. This library can later be implemented with other functions.

The first set of functions are the same functions from the libc library. 

The second set of functions are not a part of the libc but remain very useful.

Lastly, as bonuses the third set of function focuses on chained lists. 

The files are organized as followed : 
- ft_mem : for all the functions that manipulate memory
- ft_is : for all the functions that check for a specific character type in a string of characters
- ft_str : for all the functions that manipulate strings
- ft_put :
- ft_lst : for all the functions that manipulate chained lists
- ft_printf : for all the functions necessary to code the printf function
- ft_others :
